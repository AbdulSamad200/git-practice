GIT LEARNING NOTES

What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in code and collaborate with others.

Why Git is used?
- Track history of files
- Work on projects safely
- Collaborate with teams
- Undo mistakes easily

Basic Git Workflow:
1. Create or edit files
2. git status  -> check changes
3. git add .   -> stage changes
4. git commit  -> save snapshot locally
5. git push    -> upload to GitHub

Common Commands I learned today:
git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push
